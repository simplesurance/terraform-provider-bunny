bunny-go is an unofficial Go package to interact with the [Bunny.net HTTP
API](https://docs.bunny.net/reference/bunnynet-api-overview). \
It aims to be a low-level API that represents the Bunny API as close as
possible. \
The package only deviates from the API when it is necessary to prevent
confusions.

## Features

The following [API
Endpoints](https://docs.bunny.net/reference/bunnynet-api-overview) are supported:

- [ ] bunny.net API

## Example

See [client_example_test.go](client_example_test.go)

## Design Principles

- URL parameters are always passed by value as method parameter.
- Data that is sent in the HTTP body is passed as struct
  pointer to API methods.
- Pointers instead of values are used to represent fields in body messages
  structs. This allows to represent unset fields correctly.
- Message field names should be as close as possible to the JSON message field
  names. Exception are permitted if the field in the JSON messages are
  inconsistent and different names are used in the API for the same setting.
  If names are inconsistent, the variant that is closer to the naming in the
  Bunny.Net Admin Panel should be chosen. The exception must be documented in
  the godoc.

## Development

### Running Integration Tests

To run the integration test a Bunny.Net API Key is required. \
The integration tests will create, modify and delete resources on your Bunny.Net
account. Therefore it is **strongly recommended** to use a Bunny.Net account that is
**not** used in production environments. \
Bunny.Net might charge your account for certain API operations. \
The integrationtest should remove all resources that they create. It can happen
that cleaning up the resources fails and the account will contain test
leftovers.

```sh
export BUNNY_API_KEY=MY-API-KEY
make integrationtests
```

## Status

The package is under initial development and should be considered as unstable.
